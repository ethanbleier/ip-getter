# ip script
### *Remotely access ip address.*

- TODO: Hide data!
- This is mostly all template/example code
- Set your own machine's paths in `run_sender.sh`
- Assume you cannot send mail from a non-gmail email account, but this has not yet been verified
- You may have to establish an app password in your [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security)

**config.py**
```
import os
FROM_EMAIL = 'from_some_gmail@gmail.com'
TO_EMAIL = 'toAnyEmail@csumb.edu'
PASSWORD = 'your google app password'
```

__Add config.py to your .gitignore file if reusing code__
